what is c ? 
c is a programming language 

why we need programming language ?
every software's base is programming language 

how many types of programming languages ?
1.low level :which works on binary(0101) ,registors and pointers etc.
	eg. cobol,pascal,fortan,Assembly etc.
	 
	registors like (ax,bx etc) lies in RAM(Random access memory)
2.mid level : it has the features of low level programming language 
	as well as high level programming language.
eg. c and c++
3.High level : they are machine independent (write once run everywhere)
	like we can run java program in windows,linux,Mac etc.
	eg. java,python,ruby 

what is history of c ?
c is developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972 in American Telephone & telegraph (AT&T) Bells lab USA(california)

why we use C when i have high level languages like java,python etc
low level are very close to hardware and it works on hardware directly 
and the more u are near to hardware the more u will be fastest.
so low level > mid level >high level   is fastest.
low level programming is too complex for developers to understand
that's why the developers uses the mid level programming language.

In this era where is C is being used ?
1.game's backend coding. eg. pubg,clash of clans etc.
2.device driver softwares. eg. bluetooth,wifi drivers
3.most of the compilers & virtual machines. eg. jvm (java virtual machine)
4.android & linux kernals(it a type of mediater by which out application interacts with hardware)
eg. android kernal,linux kernal.
