Explanation of the above program:
Point 1: Here, * means 'value at the given address'. Thus, it adds the value of m and n which is 15.
Point 2: It subtracts the addresses of the two variables and then divides it by the size of the pointer datatype (here integer, which has size of 4 bytes) which gives us the number of elements of integer data type that can be stored within it.
Point 3: It increments the address stored by the pointer by the size of its datatype(here 4).
Point 4: It decrements the address stored by the pointer by the size of its datatype(here 4).
Point 5: Addition of two pointers is not allowed.
