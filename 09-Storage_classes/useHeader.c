/*
Every variable in C programming has two properties: type and storage class.

Type refers to the data type of a variable. And, storage class determines the scope,
visibility and lifetime of a variable.

There are 4 types of storage class:
automatic or auto( local variables )
external or extern ( global variable )
static
register

Variable stored in a CPU register can always be accessed faster
than the one that is stored in memory. Therefore,
 if a variable is used at many places in a program,
  it is better to declare its storage class as register
